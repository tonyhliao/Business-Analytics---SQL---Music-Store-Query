# Analyze NYSE Data
### Introduction 
In this project, I analyzed real-life data from the New York Stock Exchange. Udacity provided a subset of a dataset from Kaggle, which contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. This data subset can be found <a href="https://github.com/tonyhliao/Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Udacity/blob/main/Analyze%20NYSE%20Data/Original%20Dataset.csv">here</a>.

### Part 1: Summary Statistics and Industry Comparison
In order to determine whether the companies in the Semiconductor industry had similar Operating Profits compared to those in the Aerospace & Defense industry, the Gross Profit and Operating Profit had to be calculated from the dataset. 

Gross Profit = 'Total Revenue' - 'Cost of Goods Sold'\
Operating Profit = 'Gross Profit' -  'Sales, General and Admin.' - 'Research and Development' - 'Other Operating Items'

After calculating these two metrics and filtering the data, the summary statistics for both industries are as follows:

My analysis and visual chart showing the operating profits of both industries:
