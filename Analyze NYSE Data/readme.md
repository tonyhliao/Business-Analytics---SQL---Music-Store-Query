# Analyze NYSE Data
### Introduction 
In this project, I analyzed real-life data from the New York Stock Exchange. Udacity provided a subset of a dataset from Kaggle, which contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. This data subset can be found <a href="https://github.com/tonyhliao/Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Udacity/blob/main/Analyze%20NYSE%20Data/Original%20Dataset.csv">here</a>.
